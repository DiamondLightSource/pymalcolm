Running the tests
-----------------

To get the source source code and run the unit tests, run::

    $ git clone git://github.com/dls-controls/pymalcolm.git
    $ cd pymalcolm
    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages -p /path/to/python2.7 venv27
    $ . venv27/bin/activate
    $ pip install 'pip>=9.0.1'
    $ pip install -r requirements/test.txt
    $ pytest tests

While 100% code coverage does not make a library bug-free, it significantly
reduces the number of easily caught bugs! Please make sure coverage is at 100%
before submitting a pull request!

Code Quality
------------

For code quality, please run flake8::

    $ pip install flake8
    $ flake8 .

    # Third party package imports
    from mock import patch

    # Local package imports
    from malcolm.version import __version__

Please follow `Google's python style`_ guide wherever possible.
