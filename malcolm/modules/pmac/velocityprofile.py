class VelocityProfile:
    r"""
    Generate a velocity profile that starts at v1 and finishes at v2 in time t
    and travels distance d for a motor with acceleration a and maximum velocity
    v_max.

    There are 4 possible shapes: hat, inverted hat, rising or falling ramp.

    All profiles start at v1, accelerate to vm and remain there for tm and then
    accelerate to v2. Thus all profiles have 4 points, or 3 points if tm is
    zero.

    Properties:
        v1: start velocity
        v2: final velocity
        d: distance to travel
        t_total: desired minimum time between v1 and v2 (to include settle time)

        v_max: maximum speed of the motor

        t1: the time interval from v1 to vm
        tm: the time interval at vm
        t2: the time interval from vm to v2
        vm: the velocity in the middle portion of the hat or ramp
        t_out: the adjust time if t is too short to achieve d
        interval: minimum interval between any two points in a profile

        d_trough: minimum distance possible between v1,v2 in tv2
        d_peak: maximum distance possible between v1,v2 in t
