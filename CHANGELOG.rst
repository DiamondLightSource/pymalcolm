Change Log
==========
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ after 2-1.

UNRELEASED
----------

Fixed:

- ExposureDeadTimePart: removed config_tag from readout time and frequency
  accuracy and readout time attributes to prevent values being saved to
  design

Added:

- ADAndor3 driver and runnable blocks

`5.4`_ - 2022-03-30
-------------------

Changed:

- Removed rank padding on secondary and attribute datasets. Before this change,
  AreaDetector drivers using the HDF5 file writer would pad these data with an
  additional 1x1 dimension on top of the scan shape. This makes it simpler for
  plotting and visualisation. This change requires a minimum ADCore version of
  3.12 for the HDF5 file writing plugins.

`5.3`_ - 2022-03-18
-------------------

Changed:

- Implemented Double Buffering, using both Sequencer tables available on the PandA
  to be able to scan over the 2000 max number of rows, and to decrease the
  configuration time for long scans.

  See the updated "template_double_seq_pcomp" for the new recommended
  design. It is also recommended to set repeats on both of the SEQ tables to be
  '1', although the PandASeqTriggerPart does also set this when it is needed.

  This has a **breaking change** for old PandA designs as seqReset now has to be
  exported. Otherwise Stack scans where each inner scan is small enough that the
  points will not fill 2 SEQ tables (<8192 points or 30s per inner scan), but large
  enough that it will use more than 1 (>4096 points, 15s per inner scan) will fail.

Fixed:

- Fixed bug where, during a 3D scan, the first point of all inner scans after the
  first previously triggered immediately even if the outer axes was still moving.

`5.2`_ - 2022-01-05
-------------------

Changed:

- DetectorDriverPart's attributesFile is no longer saved in a design. This stops
  the warning when a populated Attributes to Capture table on the web GUI
  creates its own attributes file and overwrites the attributeFile value saved
  in the design (if present). If wanting to capture additional NDAttributes you
  can now either use the Attributes to Capture table and save it to your design,
  or alternatively create the attributes XML file via iocbuilder and set the
  attributes filepath at IOC startup.

Fixed:

- Fixed bug with PmacChildPart when performing large scans with start of row
  triggering. If the profile generation completed with more than 4,000 points
  to upload, then during Run you would encounter an error "Why do we still have
  points?". This is because the logic expected the profile to be able to written
  in a single write (i.e. under 2000 points). Now multiple profile writes are
  allowed when the brick is not providing a trigger at every point.

`5.1`_ - 2021-12-16
-------------------

Changed:

- PmacChildPart's profile generation is now split into two methods based on the
  trigger type. The loop performance has been improved, reducing configure
  times by ~20% for small scans and ~40% for large scans when profile point
  generation dominates. A Yield has also been added so the thread suspends
  after each batch so it doesn't block other threads for the entire profile
  calculation, which previously caused timeout problems with other components.
- HDFWriterPart now looks at the number of frames written to the HDF5 file to
  track progress and check for stalling issues. This means a scan will now fail
  instead of succeed if the file plugin receives all frames but doesn't write
  them.

Fixed:

- PmacChildPart now only reports progress if the brick is providing a trigger
  at every point. This means the scan block's RunnableController should now
  report more useful progress for scans using start of row triggering or
  position compare.

`5.0`_ - 2021-11-30
-------------------

Changed:

- BeamSelectorPart now supports holding at each position for different lengths
  of time based on a mutator modifying delay_after, allowing different exposures
  to be used for each detector.
- ExposureDeadTimePart now has fixed values for readout time and frequency
  accuracy. These are configurable in the YAML but are then fixed at runtime.
  This fixes a bug in validate where the resulting exposure time is different if
  the target design is not loaded before you run validate/configure.
  
  Designs for detector runnable blocks which contain these entries should be
  removed (remove the following lines from the JSON design files):

  .. code-block::

    - "readoutTime": 0.005,
    - "frequencyAccuracy": 50.0

  You can then set the readout time when you instantiate the runnable block
  (frequency accuracy is probably fine at the default value of 50.0):

  .. code-block:: yaml

    - ADPco.blocks.pco_runnable_block:
      mri_prefix: BL11K-ML-PCO-01
      pv_prefix: BL11K-EA-PCO-01
      config_dir: $(config_dir)
      windows_drive: G
      path_prefix: /dls
      readout_time: 0.005

Added:

- DetectorDriverPart now has optional min_acquire_period argument. When set to a
  non-zero value this is checked during validation against the generator
  duration to ensure the detector can keep up during the acquisition.
- Calculate generator duration automatically. If a duration of 0.0 is given
  then some parts will attempt to calculate a duration based on other parameters
  combined with other information they have. The parts which tweak duration are:

  - PmacChildPart
  - PandAPulseTriggerPart
  - DetectorDriverPart
  - ExposureDeadtimePart
  - AndorDriverPart
  - ReframePluginPart
  - BeamSelectorPart (based on a fixed move time)

  The largest tweak to generator duration by any part will win, and then all
  parts will validate with the new duration to check they are happy with the
  tweaked value. This can happen iteratively with up to 10 attempts per
  RunnableController.

Fixed

- Malcolm designs will no longer overwrite XMAP energy values
- The PreRunHook will now run at the beginning of do_run() so that it also runs
  on a resume.

`4.6`_ - 2021-08-17
-------------------

Changed:

- Added Unrolling block to be able to enable/disable unrolling part in scan
  design

  the initial 5000 points
- OdinWriterPart cast data type to lower case for NumPy V1.2
- Nexus templates for Savu Kinematics added to package data

- Scans with breakpoints and pausing are now working again after breaking in

`4.5`_ - 2021-04-27
--------------------------

Changed:

- Improvements when scanning with software outer axes:

  - Hardware-triggered detectors remain armed between inner scans
  - By default detectors write to single files for the whole scan instead of
    for each inner scan

    number of output files

  devices

`4-2b8`_ - 2020-04-17
---------------------

- Fix for 'sharksfin issue' - start positions in trajectories were
  incorrect for high acceleration motors
- Fix for sparse trajectories accumlating errors - rename the velocity modes
  as follows and use mode 2 at the end of each sparse row

  - 0 = Average Previous to Next
  - 1 = Real Previous to Current
  - 2 = Average Previous to Current (replaces Average Current to Next)
  - 3 = Zero Velocity
- Recommend V3 of the pmac Trajectory Program but allow V2 (using V2 will
  invalidate the fix above which only applies to long, sparse trajectories)
